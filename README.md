# Powershell-Scripts
A repository for Powershell  scripts written to automate repetitive tasks.

Several scripts have variables containing "Removed" string value.  These were removed for confidentiality purposes.

These scripts were written very specifically for very repetitive and long tasks given to me while I held a temporary position.
They are purely for demonstration and are not expected to function for other users.
